<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This program implements USB HID devices (mouse, keyboard and joystick).
The target is the Atmega32u4 MCU used in the Arduino Leonardo and Micro
boards. At present the following devices are implemented:

<pre><tt>
  keyboard with 101 keys including 8 modifier keys

  mouse with three buttons and a wheel
  
  joystick with 16 buttons, X and Y axis, throttle and rudder controls
  and an 8-position HAT switch
</tt></pre>

<p>The code is supposed to be compiled by the avr-gcc compiler suite. There
is a Makefile for building the program from the command line. I have tested
the build process only under Linux (Xubuntu 64-bit 16.04). In principle
it should work under other operating systems as well provided that the
avr-gcc toolchain is installed.

<p>This program is for serious developers who prefer the traditional way of
making software and don't want to use the simplistic Arduino IDE made for
beginners. A nice tutorial by Ashley Mills about the use of C/C++ (avr-gcc)
for AVR programming can be found at the following WEB site:

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>I have put together this package because I noticed that it is quite
difficult to find simple and easy to understand C code that would implement
the HID devices keyboard, mouse and joystick on Atmega MCUs. Good quality
joystick implementations are especially rare. You can find a lot of code
on the WEB for implementing a USB joystick but most of it is IMHO garbage.
These are usually perfunctorily stiched together packages using code from several
different sources and contain lots of unneeded code that makes the whole
stuff difficult to understand. In most cases documentation is non-existent
or very sketchy. And some of these packages simply don't work at all
(cannot be compiled or run).

<p>HID devices are implemented in the Arduino and Teensyduino IDEs but if
you want to do traditional programmming by using the avr-gcc you are out of
luck. People on forums suggest to use the LUFA library. Well, it does work
but IMHO it is far from being simple (concerning either code or usage)
regardless of claims to the contrary made on different forums.

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>Keyboard and mouse code are based on the following two code packages
from the PJRC.COM company:
<br><br>

<a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_keyboard.html">Keyboard example for the Teensy USB Development Board</a>
<br>
<a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_mouse.html">Mouse example with debug channel for Teensy USB Development Board</a>

<p>HID report descriptor examples for joysticks were taken from code I have
downloaded from the following site:
<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/Cryocrat/LeonardoJoystick">https://github.com/Cryocrat/LeonardoJoystick</a>

<p>I got two files (HID.cpp and USBAPI.h) to which joystick code was added
by Peter Barrett and extracted the joystick descriptor to use in my HID
code.

<h3>Device configuration</h3>

<p>You can configure the program for different boards and HID devices.

<p><b>Board type</b>
<br>
At present two Arduino boards are supported: Leonardo and Micro. Set
BOARD_TYPE in the Makefile to the desired value by uncommenting the
appropriate statement. Configuring the board type will automatically
set the product ID of the HID device to the correct value.

<p><b>HID device type</b>
<br>
You may specify one of the HID types HID_MOUSE, HID_KEYBOARD or HID_JOYSTICK
by uncommenting the appropriate statement in the Makefile. Please note that
only one type may be defined. Consequently any compiled instance of the
program supports exactly <b>one</b> HID type depending on the setting of this
value. Composite USB devices (e.g. mouse + keyboard) cannot be handled by
this program.
<br><br>

<h3>Adding code for new joystick types</h3>

<p>If you need a custom joystick with a different number of buttons, controls
and axis you have to modify two source files: <b>hid_joy.c</b> and
<b>hid_joy.h</b>.

<p>In <b>hid_joy.c</b> you should edit the HID report descriptor structure to
correspond to the number of controls (buttons, axis, etc.) you want to
implement. You should also modify the function <b>copy_report_to_buf</b>
so that it correctly copies the actual values from <b>joy_state</b> to the
hardware USB buffer of the MCU.

<p>In <b>hid_joy.h</b> you should set the constant HID_REPORT_SIZE to the
new size of the structure you edited in <b>hid_joy.c</b>. The <b>joy_state_t</b>
structure must also be modified so that it corresponds to your new setup.

<p>You should also revise the test program <b>dev_joy.c</b> for possible
code changes.

<p><b>Note:</b>
<br><br>

1. Similar modifications should be made to the <b>hid_kbd</b> or <b>hid_mou</b>
source files if you want to implement a different keyboard or mouse device.
<br><br>

2. The maximum size of report that can be copied to the hardware buffer
(i.e. the number of bytes sent, NOT the size of the HID report descriptor)
is 8 bytes for a keyboard or a mouse and 64 bytes for a joystick. Please
do not exceed these limits!
<br><br>

<a name=build>
<h3>Building the program</h3>

<p>You must have the avr-gcc package installed on your computer. You should
get it from the software repository of your distribution.

<p>In a terminal navigate to the directory where the Makefile of the
program is located and run the command <b>make</b>. If everything
is OK the program is created in the subdirectory <b>build</b>. The name of
the program will be <b>usb_keyboard.hex</b>, <b>usb_mouse.hex</b> or
<b>usb_joystick.hex</b> depending on your device setting.

<p>Three other <b>make</b> targets are available:

<pre><tt>
  make clean --> removes all files created by the build process except the
                 dependency files

  make xclean -> removes all files created by the build process

  make blink --> builds the minimal LED blinking program 'blink'
</tt></pre>

<p><b>blink.hex</b> can be used to reset the board to its factory state
(i.e. loaded with a a blink sketch and USB connection activated).
<br><br>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<hr align="left" size="2" color="808080">

<a name=burn>
<h3>Burning the program to the board</h3>

<p>Connect your board to an USB port. Open a terminal and navigate to the
directory where the Makefile is located. Start the burning script:

<pre><tt>
  ./burnhex image-name
</tt></pre>

where <b>image-name</b> is the name of the HEX file created by the build
process (in the subdirectory <b>build</b>) w/o the <b>.hex</b> extension.

<p>After the script starts you have to press the reset button of the board
and then immediately press ENTER (these instructions are displayed on the
screen).

<p>You can start your burned program by disconnecting the board and connecting
it again.

<p><b>Notes:</b>

<p>1. You have to specify in the <b>burnhex</b> script the serial port to
which the board connects when it is reset. Currently it is set to
<b>/dev/ttyACM0</b>. You can find the name of the port in the following way:

<pre><tt>
  - Connect the board to an USB port

  - In a terminal run <b>tail -f /var/log/syslog</b>

  - Press the reset button on the board

  - <b>tail</b> will display a couple of new lines about a new USB device

  - In the text printed by <b>tail</b> find the name of the port used 
    (mine was <b>/dev/ttyACM0</b> but it may be different on your machine)

  - Edit the file <b>burnhex</b> to set the variable <b>port</b> to this value
</tt></pre>

<p>2. You should have <b>python</b> and <b>python-serial</b> installed
because the <b>burnhex</b> script uses the python script <b>reset_board.py</b>
to set up the board for programming (see the content of the script if you want
to know what is done).

<p>3. The subdirectory <b>bin</b> contains the <b>avrdude</b> programmer
utility and its configuration file. That's all you need to burn a HEX image.
This is a 64-bit Linux program (from Ubuntu). If you run a 32-bit Linux
you have to get the 32-bit version of avrdude. Then you can either replace
the file <b>avrdude</b> in <b>bin</b> or modify the variables <b>conf</b>
and <b>burn</b> in the <b>burnhex</b> script to point to the newly installed
program and config files.

<a name=todo>
<h3>TODO</h3>

<p>1. Try building the program under Windows 7/8 using <b>winavr</b> (the main
hurdle here will be finding out which COM port the board uses when it
is reset for programming)

<p>2. Extend the set of boards usable with the program. This could include
the Teensy2 and Teensy3 as well as Arduino boards that have an MCU with
built-in USB support similar to the Atmega32u4.
